# DEMAND-FORECASTING-OF-A-FOOD-STORE-ANALYSIS-AN-INDIA-MEAL-DELIVERY-COMPANY
This is a research dissertation for the partial fulfillment for the degree of MSc Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics.

The food and beverage industry are one of the most important sectors in any country's 
economy. Predicting food demand is a daunting task. Especially when online and in-store 
orders generate a wealth of data that needs to be efficiently stored, analysed, understood, 
and ultimately runnable in a very short time. The project uses a variety of machine learning 
algorithms, including web applications that allow users to predict food demand in the 
coming weeks, to predict different food demands in different food delivery businesses in 
different regions.
